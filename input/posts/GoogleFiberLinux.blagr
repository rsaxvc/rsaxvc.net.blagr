Google Fiber requires a slightly esoteric network configuration.
First, traffic between the on-premises Google equipment and
their network. When replacing the Google router with a debian
Linux computer, this can be configured with
<a href="https://gist.github.com/rsaxvc/92a7d70c7fc62289fe78347142a9925e">
this /etc/network/interfaces file for Debian Linux</a>, which requires
the bridge-utils and vlan debian packages.

Next is configuring QoS bits, which can also be done through
some slightly more advanced scripting in /etc/network/interfaces,
though I have not completed updating the linked gist with it.
