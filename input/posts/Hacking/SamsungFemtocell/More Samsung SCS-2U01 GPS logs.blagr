Today, I took a friend driving. The purpose? To drive up and down an east-west street to see how the gps output changes. The friend's purpose? To hold a probe onto some serial lines as I tackled one of the bumpiest roads in Missouri. And boy does it change. There's new sentences available and other things I don't yet understand. Anyhow,&nbsp;<a href="http://rsaxvc.net/blog/serialgps.31stSt.cap.lzma">serialgps.31stSt.cap.lzma<br /></a>
