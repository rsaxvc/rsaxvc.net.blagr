<div>A while back I ended up with a bunch of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIA_C3" title="VIA C3" rel="wikipedia">Via C3</a>-based thin clients. Each one came with a 16MB IDE flash card designed by PQI Industrial. Today I took one apart.<br /></div>

You'll need two screwdrivers to get it to happen at the same time, or you can break one and hold the other with the driver.<br />

<div>After pulling back the device, you can see a standard flash TSSOP.<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40925843@N03/5921523849/" title="PQI IDE Flash Teardown by rsaxvc, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6143/5921523849_4bc4d07d1f.jpg" alt="PQI IDE Flash Teardown" height="333" width="500" /></a></div><br /><div>On the back is the TDK TSSOP&lt;-&gt;IDE controller.<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40925843@N03/5922086682/" title="PQI IDE Flash Teardown by rsaxvc, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6013/5922086682_2edd9713c6.jpg" alt="PQI IDE Flash Teardown" height="333" width="500" /></a><br /><br /></div><br />

<div>In particular, this device uses a GBDriverRA2e, which is an older design.<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40925843@N03/5921520591/" title="PQI IDE Flash Teardown by rsaxvc, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6028/5921520591_4c91725e52.jpg" alt="PQI IDE Flash Teardown" height="333" width="500" /></a><br /><br />I'm curious if I can pick up some cheap thumbdrives to make my own internal SSDs. However, the number of computers I own with IDE slots is quickly dwindling, although these may find themselves in some small embedded x86 projects.</div>
