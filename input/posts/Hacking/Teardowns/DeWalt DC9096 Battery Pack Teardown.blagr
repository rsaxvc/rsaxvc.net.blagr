<div><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.dewalt.com/" title="DeWalt" rel="homepage">DeWalt</a> makes some nice tools. Today, I disassembled a DC9096 Nickel-Cadmium battery. I was intrigued by the fact that there only appears to be space for 14 sub-c cells in the battery, but 15 cells are needed to reach 18 volts. Also, I wanted to examine the possibility of replacing the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel-cadmium_battery" title="Nickel-cadmium battery" rel="wikipedia">NiCad</a> cells with <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel-metal_hydride_battery" title="Nickel-metal hydride battery" rel="wikipedia">NiMH</a> cells, which can last much longer.</div>

<br />
<div>It should come out fairly easily, but some wiggling may be required</div>

<br />
<div>It doesn't add up. 14*1.2 = 16.8, not 18 Volts. There must be another cell</div>

<div> What's this?</div>

<br />
<div> Here it is. There didn't seem to be a good way to remove the other cells, so I cut them, and pulled the ribbon wire from the 15th cell. These appear to be welded on to the cell four times at each connection.</div>
