The key to running <a class="zem_slink" href="http://hulu.com" title="hulu" rel="homepage">Hulu</a> on Android is getting a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent" title="User agent" rel="wikipedia">User-Agent string</a> and Flash Version String that match. Previously I posted&nbsp;<a href="http://rsaxvc.net/blog/2011/01/changing-your-google-chrome-flash-version.html">how to change your flash version</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://rsaxvc.net/blog/2011/01/running-hulu-on-android.html">how to change your flash version on Android</a>. However, you need to match your User-Agent and Flash String. That is to say, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.adobe.com/flashplatform/" title="Adobe Flash" rel="homepage">Adobe Flash</a> "MAC 10.Sandwich" failed rather quickly.<div><br /></div><div><div>By default, Android supports 3 User-Agents: Intel Mac Desktop, Android, and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" title="iPhone" rel="homepage">iPhone</a>.&nbsp;By changing my user-agent to appear as an Intel Mac Desktop running 10.5.7, I was able to use Hulu for a little while, but it stopped working within a day. I suspect that this is due to the fact I have no idea what flash runs on 10.5.7, making it easy to blacklist. If anyone knows a flash version for 10.5.7 that runs Hulu, let me know, as then you could run Hulu without a full firmware update.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>My current solution is to use <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/" title="CyanogenMod" rel="homepage">CyanogenMod</a>, which supports a User-Agent of IE6. I copied the Android Version from my desktop, "WIN 10,1,103,20" to libflashplayer.so on my phone. Since doing this, Hulu has run, albeit slowly.</div><div><br /></div><div>What's the downside to this little hack? Since the User-Agent and Flash Version are both for desktops, every website thinks you are running a full desktop with plenty of RAM. Each flash library that contains mobile optimizations won't use them, because it thinks it is running on a desktop. Also, Hulu renders in full quality and full bandwidth.</div><div><br /></div><div>The results? 1-2 FPS, and sound that actually doesn't skip. I'm running a fairly sketchy overclock to 800MHz. However, I was able to test this on a 1GHz T-Mobile G2, which performed much better, and since Flash uses 40-50 threads while playing, I hope it scales well to multiple cores just like it does on desktops.</div>
