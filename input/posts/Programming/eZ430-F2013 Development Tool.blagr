Normally I take apart all new toys, but this one has only 5 parts, and is designed to come apart easily. It costs only $20, available from TI&nbsp;<a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/toolsw/folders/print/ez430-f2013.html">here</a>. Previously, there was a giveaway for up to 3 units, although you had to wait up to a month for shipping and handling.<div><br /></div><div>Packaging: I'm a big fan of the DVD case and double thick DVD case form factors. This comes in a single DVD case:<br /><div><br /></div></div>

<div><br /></div><div>Looks a lot like a thumbdrive, which is a great form factor for something like this:</div>

<div><br /></div><div>Here's the important part</div>

<div><br /></div><div>It breaks apart into two pieces: the USB to RSR232/RS485 with TUSB3410, and the MSP430 itself:</div>

<div><br /></div><div>For some perspective, this is sitting on an American Lincoln Penny<div>

One, is the MSP430 microcontroller. Two, is the USB to Serial Adapter. The serial adapter is a TUSB3410, which also holds an 8052 microcontroller with 16K of RAM, 10K of ROM, UART with DMA, dual 16-bit timers, IRDA encoder/decoder, and also I2C.</div>
