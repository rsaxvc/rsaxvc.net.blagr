<div>I guess I can post this now. A while back I built a custom receiver to attach the Garmin <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=89575">Montana Rugged Mount</a> to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40925843@N03/tags/vf750/">Honda Magna</a>. This product is a harness for the <a href="http://sites.garmin.com/montana/">Montana GPS</a> that fits the <a href="http://www.ram-mount.com/Products/MotorcycleMounts/tabid/128/Default.aspx#/wizard">RAM bracket mounting system</a>. However, most of their mounts involve some sort of arm mechanism, and I had a much better location on my bike. The Montana mounts just below the instrument cluster, almost like it belongs there. I used four strips of aluminum, two on each side, to hold the mount to the handlebars. I need to find some stainless steel bolts, as the hardware store didn't have the right ones and they're showing a little rust. The swap will be a good winter project.</div>
