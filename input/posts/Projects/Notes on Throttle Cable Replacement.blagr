<div>You might not notice it at first, and I certainly didn't, but there's a very easy mistake to be made when installing a new throttle cable.</div><br/>

However, since the screw is on the bottom of the handlebar it is easy to miss. Also, since another plate holds the collar down, it is hard to see misalignment. Also, depending on the degree of misalignment, the throttle may work, but be a little sticky</div><br/>

New cable, new screws, and new plate</div>
