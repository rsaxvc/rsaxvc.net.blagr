<div>A while back I had the idea of building a device that would optically sort coins. I've always been fascinated by the gravity-fed machines that sort different sizes of coins into bins. I want to take it further. I would like to be able to sort my coins by date into different tubes not only by size, but also color, year, and maybe quality.<br /><br />The first step for this, is to build a test rig that can hold a camera and different coins:</div>

<div>Once the computer+camera can make a repeatable good decision, I'll build a system to move the coins into different storage containers, but for now I'll settle for detecting different coins.</div>
