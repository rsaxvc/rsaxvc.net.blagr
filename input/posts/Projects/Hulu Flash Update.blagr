Sometime in the last 8 hours, flash has stopped playing Hulu on my phone. I'll look into why this is happening now.<div><br /></div><div>Also, it appears that the browser can use a very large amount of RAM while playing Hulu. Without closing all other applications, the flash player would run out of memory and drop to tap-to-play mode.&nbsp;</div>
